1. This is a guide to show off the Wrath of the Lich King and 3.3.5 SteamDeck UI i made. This game and files can be installed in the same way as is discribed in my Turtle Wow UI video. If you need to know how then check that video first.
2. Make sure to name the game: Word of Warcraft W O T L K so you will be able to find my controller layout as you can see here.
3. If you placed the files into your wow folder and renamed everything correctly. The game should look like this for you
4. Open up the bartender4 options by right clicking the icon on your minimap. Then go the Profiles section and Copy from profile Ryac.
5. Now you can drag your spells onto the correct action buttons.
6. I suggest to use the target nearest enemy macro and place it on the L1 action button here.
7. Next move the chat window into place.Then change the minimap to the version you want. I use the square map usually. Now you are ready to play
8. Now i will show you how to use the swap action bar addon since this bar addon does not work the same way as the turtle wow addon. This is used for classes with shapeshifting and stances like Rogue.
9. The addon is called Action Bar saver. It allows you to save the current action buttons used and load another one. This can be used to automatically change when swapping stances or stealthing.
10. In the macros i added 4 Save and 4 load buttons to save 4 sets of action buttons. I also added a rogue stealth macro so when the rogue stealths it loads set 2 and when it unstealths it loads set 1 again. 
11. If you plan to use this addon then make sure to save your action buttons each time you change them. You can use the Save1 and Save 2 buttons as i show here.
